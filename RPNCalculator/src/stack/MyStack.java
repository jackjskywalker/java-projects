 * Implementation of a Stack Abstract Type using Linked List example
 * - I have not discussed the source code in my program with anyone other than my instructor’s approved human sources (i.e. programming partner).
 * - I have not used source code obtained from another student, or any other unauthorized source, either modified or unmodified.
 * - If any source code or documentation used in my program was obtained from another source, such as a text book or course notes, that has been clearly noted *   with a proper citation in the comments of my program.
 * - I have not knowingly designed this program in such a way as to defeat or interfere with the normal operation of any machine it is graded on or to produce     apparently correct results when in fact it does not.
 * NOTE: !!! you don't have to change anything in this file !!!
